# Preliminary documentation for v.0.0.3

## GVClient.connect(method,options,callback)
* `method` (String,required): 'call', 'sms', or 'cancel' (cancels the most recent call)
* `options` (Object)
	* required for `method == 'call'`
		* `forwardingNumber` (String, required) : one of your Google Voice forwarding numbers. This can also be your Google Voice login (`'username@gmail.com'`) to connect to Google Talk or have it ring in Gmail.
		* `phoneType` (Integer, required) : the phone type of `forwardingPhone`.  It can be one of the following values:
			* 1 - Home
			* 2 - Mobile
			* 3 - Work
			* 7 - Gizmo (this may not work anymore as Gizmo has been shut down by Google)
			* 9 - Google Talk
		* `outgoingNumber` (String, required) : the number to connect the forwarding phone to
		* `date` (Array or Date, optional) : If a `date` parameter is included in `options`, the call/text/cancel will be scheduled for that time, if it is a future time.
			* `date` can be: 
			 	* an Array of the form `[Year, Month, Day, Hour, Minute, Second, Millisecond]` . This array must contain *at least* the year; the other parameters are optional. If a parameter is not specified, it will default to null. Therefore, [2011] will schedule the event or January 01, 2011 12:00 AM. [2011,05,01,null,30] will schedule the event for May 01, 2011 12:30AM.
				* a Date object : Using, for example, `new Date()`
			* an optional `overwrite` (True/False, default = true) parameter can be included for scheduling requests. The `overwrite` property specifies whether a scheduling request can unschedule an event that is scheduled at the same time.
	* required for `method == 'sms'`
		* `outgoingNumber` (String or Array, required) : The number to which the SMS will be sent. Can be an Array of Strings to send the text to multiple numbers.
		* `text` (String, optional, default = `' '`) : The text message to send. If empty, it will default to `' '`.
		* `date` (Array or Date, optional) : see above for explanation
		* `overwrite` (True/False, default = true) : see above for explanation
	* optional for `method == 'cancel'`
		* `date` (Array or Date, optional) : see above for explanation
		* `overwrite` (True/False, default = true) : see above for explanation
* `callback` (Function: `function(status,body,response)`, optional) where
	* `status` (Integer) : a status code specifying the result of the request. The possible status codes are given in `GVClient.STATUS_CODES`. See "STATUS_CODES" below for more information. 
	* `body` is one of the following:
		* Object formed from the JSON response from Google Voice, typically something like the following examples: 
			* `{ ok: true, data: { code: 0 } }`
			* `{ ok: false, error: 'Cannot complete call.' }`
			* `{ ok: false, data: { code: 20 } }`
		* String containing the HTML response from Google Voice (for cases when the body of the response doesn't contain JSON, or if the JSON couldn't be parsed)
	* `response` (http.ClientResponse) is the instance of Node's [http.ClientResponse](http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.7/api/http.html#http.ClientResponse) corresponding to that particular request. It is provided for cases where you would like to get more information about what went wrong (or right!) and act on it. 
	   Note that the `response` has a `response.statusCode`, which corresponds to the 3-digit HTTP response code. For cases when `status` is `600` (HTTP_ERROR), it is important to check the HTTP response status code to determine what went wrong.

## GVClient.get(options,callback)
* `options` (String or Object, required): `options` can be a String, or one of two Object types:
	* to retrieve messages from one of the standard Google Voice labels, use one of the following Strings. Note that this will return ALL results of the given request type (equivalent to setting `limit=-1` (see below)).
	
	```javascript
		'history'
		'inbox'
		'spam'
		'trash'
		'starred'
		'sms'
		'voicemail'
		'placed'
		'missed'
		'received'
		'recorded'
	```

	* to set a limit on the number of returned messages, use an Object with the following properties:
		* `type` (String, required) : one of the 11 Strings given above
		* `limit` (Integer, optional, default = -1) : limits the number of returned messages to a certain number, ordered by message time. So `limit=1` will return the most recent message of the given request, and `limit=10` will return the 10 most recent messages. If `limit = -1`, ALL messages will be returned (can be slow for very large message lists)
	* to search for messages matching a particular search string, use an Object with the following properties:
		* `query` (String) : This last form retrieves messages that match the given query in some way. The search function is entirely implemented by Google Voice, so the search results are the same as would be returned by searching from the Google Voice web interface.
		* `limit` (Integer, optional, default = -1) : see above for explanation
* `callback` (Function `function(status, messages)`)
	* `status` (Integer) : the status of the request. See "STATUS CODES" below for more information.
	* `messages` (Array) : an Array of message Objects. Each message object is formed from the JSON response from Google Voice; the format is therefore subject to change. At the time of this writing, an example message looked like this:

		```javascript	
			{ id: 'someStringIdentifier',
			  phoneNumber: '+18005551212',
			  displayNumber: '(800) 555-1212',
			  startTime: '1305138033000',
			  displayStartDateTime: '5/11/11 2:20 PM',
			  displayStartTime: '2:20 PM',
			  relativeStartTime: '3 weeks ago',
			  note: '',
			  isRead: true,
			  isSpam: false,
			  isTrash: false,
			  star: false,
			  labels: [ 'missed', 'all' ],
			  type: 0,
			  children: '' 
			}
		```
			
		* SMS messages (messages with 'sms' as one of the labels) have some additional properties and methods:
			* `thread` (Array) : an array of DOM elements (made with jsdom), each containing three child elements, corresponding to `text`, `from`, `time`
			* `lastText` (String) : the most recent text message in the SMS thread
			* `getValue(param)` : a method for extracting one of the three parameters of a message DOM element. This is used with the DOM elements in `thread` to get 
				* the relative time of the message: `msgDOMelement.getValue('time')`
				* the sender's identification: 	`msgDOMelement.getValue('from')`
				* the text message: `msgDOMelement.getValue('text')`

## GVClient.set(options,messageIDs,callback)
* `options` (String or Object, required): A String or one of two types of Objects:
	* To mark (un)read, (un)star, (un)archive, (un)trash, delete, or (un)block the message(s), use one of the following Strings:
	```javascript
		'markRead' 
		'markUnread'
		'archive'
		'unarchive'
		'star'
		'unstar'
		'deleteForever' // permanently deletes the message(s)
		'toggleTrash' //calling this on a message will move it to the inbox if it is in the trash OR will move it to the trash if it is somewhere else
		'block' // block the number associated with the message
		'unblock' // unblock the number associated with the message
	```
	
	* To add a note to the message, use an Object with the following property:
		* `note` (String, required) : a note to be saved with the message (note that setting a note can only be done on one message at a time)
	* To forward a *voicemail* message, use an Object with the following properties:
		* `forward` (String or Array, required) : One email address string, or an Array of email addresses to forward the message to
		* `subject` (String, optional, default = ' ') : The subject of the forwarded message
		* `body` (String, optional, default = ' ') : The body of the email message
		* `link` (True/False, optional, default = false) : Whether or not to include a link to the voicemail message in the email
* `messageIDs` (String or Array, required) : unique Google Voice message id(s). The message ID can be had from the message objects returned by `GVClient.get()` (discussed above)
	* The first `set()` approach described above (with a String) can set more than one message at a time:
		* use a String with the message ID to manipulate one message
		* use an Array of message ID Strings to manipulate multiple messages simultaneously
	* The other two `set()` methods (with an Object), can only manipulate one message at a time:
		* Use a message ID String for these operations. If you pass an Array of message IDs, only the first message will be targeted.
* `callback` (Function `function(status,body,response)`, optional) - a callback function that behaves identically to the callback in `GVClient.connect()`. See that section for more information.
