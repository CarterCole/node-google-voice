# Preliminary documentation for v.0.0.3

## GVClient.connect(method,options,callback)
* `method` (String,required): 'call', 'sms', or 'cancel'
* `options` (Object)
	* required for `method == 'call'`
		* `forwardingNumber` (String, required) : one of your Google Voice forwarding numbers. This can also be your Google Voice login (`'username@gmail.com'`) to connect to Google Talk or have it ring in Gmail.
		* `phoneType` (Integer, required) : the phone type of `forwardingPhone`.  It can be one of the following values:
			* 1 - Home
			* 2 - Mobile
			* 3 - Work
			* 7 - Gizmo (this may not work anymore as Gizmo has been shut down by Google)
			* 9 - Google Talk
		* `outgoingNumber` (String, required) : the number to connect the forwarding phone to
		* `date` (Array or Date, optional) : If a `date` parameter is included in `options`, the call/text/cancel will be scheduled for that time, if it is a future time. `date` can be:
			* Array of the form [Year, Month, Day, Hour, Minute, Second, Millisecond] . This array must contain *at least* the year; the other parameters are optional. If a parameter is not specified, it will default to null. Therefore, [2011] will schedule the event or January 01, 2011 12:00 AM. [2011,05,01,null,30] will schedule the event for May 01, 2011 12:30AM.
			* Date object : Using, for example, `new Date()`
	* required for `method == 'sms'`
		* `outgoingNumber` (String or Array, required) : The number to which the SMS will be sent. Can be an Array of Strings to send the text to multiple numbers.
		* `text` (String, optional, default = `' '`) : The text message to send. If empty, it will default to `' '`.
		* `date` (Array or Date, optional) : see above for explanation
	* optional for `method == 'cancel'`
		* `date` (Array or Date, optional) : see above for explanation
* `callback` (Function: `function(status,body,response)`, optional) where
	* `status` (Integer) is an integer specifying the result of the request. The possible status codes are given in `GVClient.STATUS_CODES`. See "STATUS_CODES" below for more information. 
	* `body` is one of the following:
		* Object formed from the JSON response from Google Voice, typically something like the following examples: 
			* `{ ok: true, data: { code: 0 } }`
			* `{ ok: false, error: 'Cannot complete call.' }`
			* `{ ok: false, data: { code: 20 } }`
		* String containing the HTML response from Google Voice (for cases when the body of the response doesn't contain JSON, or if the JSON couldn't be parsed)
	* `response` (http.ClientResponse) is the instance of Node's [http.ClientResponse](http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.7/api/http.html#http.ClientResponse) corresponding to that particular request. It is provided for cases where you would like to get more information about what went wrong (or right!) and act on it. 
	   Note that the `response` has a `response.statusCode`, which corresponds to the 3-digit HTTP response code. For cases when `status` is `600` (HTTP_ERROR), it is important to check the HTTP response status code with `response.statusCode` to determine what went wrong.

## GVClient.get(options,callback)
* `options` (String or Object, required): `options` can be a String, or one of two Object types:
	* One of the following Strings:
	
	```javascript
		'history'
		'inbox'
		'spam'
		'trash'
		'starred'
		'sms'
		'voicemail'
		'placed'
		'missed'
		'received'
		'recorded'
	```
	This will return ALL results of the given request type (equivalent to setting `limit=-1` (see below)). 
	
	* Object with the following properties:
		* `type` (String, required) : one of the 11 Strings given above
		* `limit` (Integer, optional) : limits the number of returned messages to a certain number, ordered by time. So `limit=1` will return the most recent message of the given request and `limit=10` will return the 10 most recent messages. If `limit = -1`, ALL messages will be returned (can be slow for very large message lists)
	* Object with the following properties:
		* `query` (String) : This last form retrieves messages that match the given query in some way. The search function is entirely implemented by Google Voice, so the search results are the same as would be returned by searching from the Google Voice web interface.
		* `limit` (Integer,optional) : see above for explanation
