# Preliminary documentation for v.0.0.3

## GVClient.connect(method,options,callback)
* `method` (String,required): 'call', 'sms', or 'cancel'
* `options` (Object)
	* required for `method == 'call'`
		* `forwardingNumber` (String, required) : one of your Google Voice forwarding numbers. This can also be your Google Voice login (`'username@gmail.com'`) to connect to Google Talk or have it ring in Gmail.
		* `phoneType` (Integer, required) : the phone type of `forwardingPhone`.  It can be one of the following values:
			* 1 - Home
			* 2 - Mobile
			* 3 - Work
			* 7 - Gizmo (this may not work anymore as Gizmo has been shut down by Google)
			* 9 - Google Talk
		* `outgoingNumber` (String, required) : the number to connect the forwarding phone to
	* required for `method == 'sms'`
		* `outgoingNumber` (String or Array, required) : The number to which the SMS will be sent. Can be an Array of Strings to send the text to multiple numbers.
		* `text` (String, optional, default = `' '`) : The text message to send. If empty, it will default to `' '`.
	* optional for `method == 'cancel'`
	
	If a `date` parameter is included in `options`, the call/text/cancel will be scheduled for that time, if it is a future time. `date` can be:
	* Array of the form [Year, Month, Day, Hour, Minute, Second, Millisecond] . This array must contain *at least* the year; the other parameters are optional. If a parameter is not specified, it will default to null. Therefore, [2011] will schedule the event or January 01, 2011 12:00 AM. [2011,05,01,null,30] will schedule the event for May 01, 2011 12:30AM.
	* Date object : using the `new Date()`

* `callback` (Function: `function(status,body,response)`, optional) where
	* `status` (Integer) is an integer specifying the result of the request. The possible status codes are given in `GVClient.STATUS_CODES`. See "STATUS_CODES" below for more information. 
	* `body` is one of the following:
		* Object formed from the JSON response from Google Voice, typically something like the following examples: 
			* `{ ok: true, data: { code: 0 } }`
			* `{ ok: false, error: 'Cannot complete call.' }`
			* `{ ok: false, data: { code: 20 } }`
		* String containing the HTML response from Google Voice (for cases when the body of the response doesn't contain JSON, or if the JSON couldn't be parsed)
	* `response` (http.ClientResponse) is the instance of Node's [http.ClientResponse](http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.7/api/http.html#http.ClientResponse) corresponding to that particular request. It is provided for cases where you would like to get more information about what went wrong (or right!) and act on it. 
	
	Note that the `response` has a `response.statusCode`, which corresponds to the 3-digit HTTP response code. For cases when `status` is `600` (HTTP_ERROR), it is important to check the HTTP response status code with `response.statusCode` to determine what went wrong.
